implement writing on file to save the current album state
		better save on every change or on program exit? 
		https://dzone.com/articles/know-jvm-series-2-shutdown   shutdown hooks
		if we choose to save everytime user modifies something, we could use a thread? make a specific class?
		if i use a thread for every time i refresh a resource i could risk to overload the system. (every 10 changes force writing, and use shutdown hooks to write in the end)
